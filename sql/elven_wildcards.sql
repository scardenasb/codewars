-- Deep within the fair realm of Lothl√≥rien, you have been asked to create a shortlist of candidates for a 
-- recently vacated position on the council.
--
-- Of so many worthy elves, who to choose for such a lofty position? After much thought you decide to select
-- candidates by name, which are often closely aligned to an elf's skill and temperament.
--
-- Choose those with tegil appearing anywhere in their first name, as they are likely to be good calligraphers, 
-- OR those with astar anywhere in their last name, who will be faithful to the role.
--
-- Elves table:
--
-- firstname
-- lastname
-- all names are in lowercase
--
-- To aid the scribes, return the firstname and lastname column concatenated, separated by a space, into a single 
-- shortlist column, and capitalise the first letter of each name.k


select concat(upper(left(firstname, 1)), 
              substring(firstname, 2), 
              ' ', 
              upper(left(lastname, 1)), 
              substring(lastname, 2))
as shortlist
from elves
where firstname like '%tegil%' or lastname like '%astar%'
